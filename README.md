# Dinner for Devs
## Simple recipes for lazy programmers

I love cooking and learning about food. I have met quite a few developers who feel the same way. Recipes are just like code, right? I have also met quite a few developers who do not feel this way, and who use ignorance as an excuse for a poor or uninteresting diet. Your meal choices are your own, but if you'd like to have a few easy-to-memorize, go-to dinner options, here are some possibilities for your next meal. Bon app√©tit!

### Basic assumptions

- Only use freshly ground black pepper (i.e. buy black peppercorns in a grinder). If you use pre-ground pepper from a shaker, please move on to a different website.
- Kosher salt is preferred to other varieties, but you can use fancy sea salt or whatever if you must. Don't use the cheap stuff.
- Do not purchase Parmesan cheese that looks like sawdust.
- Plugra butter or any butter with a slightly higher fat content ("European butter") is preferred. Do not buy salted butter. Certainly do not buy margarine, or I will find you.
- Let butter warm to room temperature before you use it. Or just don't refrigerate it at all. Likewise for eggs.
- Get the best extra virgin olive oil you can find, preferably Greek.
- If you burn the oil, dump it out and try again. It's ruined.
- If you need to dump out copious amounts of oil or fat, let it cool and pour it into the garbage. If you pour it down the sink, you will regret it.
- Never put food into a cold cooking vessel. Heat it up first, along with any cooking fat you may be using.
- "Burnt" is not a flavor.
- Blanch and shock veggies before cooking them, if you can spare the time. That means having ice available. It's worth it.
- Learn how to cut onions correctly. Do not dice them. Do not cut off the tip of your thumb.
- Use a serrated blade when slicing tomatoes and other thin-skinned foods. Learn to use a paring knife. Use kitchen scissors to cut anything weird or stubborn. I use them to cut basil, because slicing it seems stupid.
- Get an oven thermometer and use it. Get a meat thermometer and use it.
