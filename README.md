# Dinner for Devs
## Simple recipes for lazy programmers

I love cooking and learning about food. I have met quite a few developers who feel the same way. Recipes are just like code, right? I have also met quite a few developers who do not feel this way, and who use ignorance as an excuse for a poor or uninteresting diet. Your meal choices are your own, but if you'd like to have a few easy-to-memorize, go-to dinner options, here are some possibilities for your next meal. Bon app√©tit!
