# Shakshuka, Because Your Breakfast is Boring

_By Steven Syrek_

I first ate shakshuka many years ago at a hard-to-find but supposedly famous little place called [Dr. Shakshuka](http://www.doctorshakshuka.co.il/) in Jaffa, Israel. The menu was entirely in Hebrew, and nobody there spoke English. I indicated to the nice woman who came to take my order that I would like to eat something. She smiled knowingly and before I knew it was piling my table with—I'm pretty sure—every item on the menu. And charged me for, at most, one of them. And so this dish became one of those travel discoveries I had to incorporate into my repertoire. Casting about for recipes, I eventually landed on a version by [Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/shakshuka-with-red-peppers-and-cumin-56389454) in their excellent [Jerusalem: A Cookbook](http://a.co/gnqU3ye). They were inspired by Dr. Shakshuka. Anyway, you can certainly just make their version, or any other—there are many. This one is the lazy programmer's version, a perfect breakfast of first resort, especially if you already made [tomato sauce](worlds-greatest-tomato-sauce.md).

## Ingredients

- [World's Greatest Tomato Sauce](worlds-greatest-tomato-sauce.md) or other, inferior tomato sauce
- extra virgin olive oil
- the number of eggs you would like to eat
- harissa or other spicy red pepper paste (it's fun to [make your own](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/harissa-51185010), but you can just buy it, too)
- ground cumin
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- red bell pepper, sliced to your liking (optional)
- mushrooms, sliced to your liking (optional)
- garlic, chopped (optional)
- coriander, chopped (optional)
- feta cheese or plain yogurt (optional)

## Preparation

1. Place a large skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the olive oil. Watch the oil carefully. It should start to glisten and ever so slightly bubble. At that point, it should be hot enough to add the garlic. Add the garlic.
2. Just before the garlic browns, add the harissa, cumin, salt, pepper, and any optional veggies (but not the cheese or greens). How much, you ask? It depends what you like. I generally add a few generous dollops of harissa and what probably amounts to half a tablespoon of cumin. But I like spicy food, and I love cumin. So do whatever suits you. If you go nuts with the mushrooms, which is laudable, you might need to moisturize them with some extra oil. If you went easy on the harissa (come on, it's not _that_ spicy!), add a tablespoon of the tomato sauce. Or even just do that anyway. Smush everything together and stir around with the oil.
3. When the mixture has reduced slightly, or the added veggies are soft (6-8 minutes), add the tomato sauce. Simmer until the mixture has thickened enough that you can sort of almost sculpt it, about 10 minutes.
4. Using the back of a ladle or a big spoon, make one indentation in the sauce for each egg you intend to poach. Then crack each egg into its designated indentation. Try not to break the yolks. If you're fearless (or stupid), you can just crack them on the side of the skillet. This is what I usually do, even though it's a bad idea and I frequently end up fishing bits of shell out of the sauce. Be smart, and crack the eggs on a flat surface instead. Like a plate. You can even use little bowls and pour them in one at a time if you're a perfectionist—and why shouldn't you be? This is breakfast!
5. Gently simmer the shakshuka until the eggs are set. This is the hard part. Eggs are the hardest food to get right. 8-10 minutes should be plenty, slightly less if you cover the skillet (as I do). Your best bet is to remove the skillet from the heat just as the whites actually become white but before the yolks look quite done.
6. Let the skillet rest for a few minutes, and the eggs will finish cooking on their own. You're going to have to practice cooking eggs for awhile before you'll be any good at it, so err on the side of slightly undercooked (overcooked eggs are disgusting).
7. Take a photo of the skillet, and post it to Instagram. Serve to an admiring partner or, greedily, to yourself. If you're using feta, coriander, or some other green garnish, sprinkle it on top. If you're using yogurt, drop a spoonful or two on the side. Oh the colors! A respectable person eats shakshuka with crusty bread. Dip it into the yolk. Use it to clean all the sauce off your plate. Try to get on with your day.
