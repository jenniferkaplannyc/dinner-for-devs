# World's Greatest Tomato Sauce

_By Steven Syrek_

I always thought I would take this recipe, more like a family tradition, to my grave. Why? Because I liked the idea of taking something to my grave. But that would be depriving even some small part of humanity of the deeply satisfying pleasure of homemade tomato sauce—or as my mother still calls it, gravy. The problem isn't that people aren't making their sauce correctly. It's that most people don't make their own sauce at all. My family is Italian-American, so I've been eating homemade sauce my entire life. My father taught me how to make it myself, and I've been doing it now for about 20 years (as of this writing). Both of my parents, both well into their seventies, still do it, too. This means that it's almost impossible for me to enjoy eating out at Italian restaurants. Most of them are mediocre, and even the good ones aren't worth the money when you can just spoil yourself like this. Do it. It takes time, but the steps are simple. Just go code or something while it's simmering of a Sunday.

## Ingredients

_Note: I do this largely through intuition, so I don't have exact measurements to offer. Adjust the amounts of these ingredients to your taste and depending on how much sauce you are making. I generally fill a five quart sauce pan and freeze whatever I'm not using immediately. This is the best way to go._

- Canned San Marzano tomatoes: whole, crushed, or pureed (stop here if you're not willing to use them or incorrectly think that fresh tomatoes are better—your fresh tomatoes will never be good enough)
- As many Italian sausages as you can fit into the pan, one layer with room to breathe, preferably fennel but garlic is OK (leave them out for the vegan version, which I made for years so don't worry it's fine)
- Whole cloves of fresh garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
- Fresh basil
- Extra virgin olive oil
- One large yellow onion, peeled _but not sliced or chopped_ (seriously, a big one)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Preparation

1. Open the can(s) of tomatoes. You'll burn the oil in the next step if you don't have the tomato pulp ready to go. If you bought whole tomatoes, chop or puree them in a blender or food processor, depending on the consistency of sauce you desire. If you bought crushed or diced tomatoes, you can leave them as they are for a chunkier sauce or go ahead and puree those, too.
2. Set a burner to medium, and heat up the largest saucepan you have—five quarts is ideal. When warm, add a generous splash of olive oil. When the oil begins to glaze over and just barely bubble with tiny, little baby bubbles, add the sausages. You should hear a sizzling sound that reminds you of your childhood. If you don't, the oil isn't hot enough. If you see smoke, the oil is too hot (and likely ruined). Brown the sausages, turning them frequently. When they look pretty, remove them.
3. Immediately add the sliced garlic. You already sliced it, right? It's called [mise en place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), you barbarian. The garlic will sizzle and start to darken in color. Just before it turns brown, add the tomato pulp, or puree, or whatever you have. All of it. Scrape the sides of the cans with a spatula if you have to. Waste nothing!
4. Stir the sauce with a wooden spoon.
5. Add the browned sausages.
6. Add the whole onion.
7. Add as much basil as you can stand. I used to chop it. Then I just tore it up with my hands. Then I saw the guy from [Di Fara Pizza](http://www.difarany.com/) cutting basil with kitchen shears, so now I do that.
8. Drizzle in some more olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
9. Stir the sauce.
10. Cover the pot, but leave the lid slightly ajar. Lower the heat to the absolute minimum. Heat gently for 3-6 hours, the longer the better (but not so long that it turns into paste). Stir the sauce every 15-30 minutes.

The trick is to let the flavors gradually blend together as the sauce simmers and thickens. But you don't want it to burn, so you need to stir it periodically. This is the most critical factor of the recipe. You must stir the sauce. If you don't, it will burn. If you burn the sauce, pour the entire contents of the saucepan into your bed to teach yourself a lesson and start over. This time, stir the sauce. _Do not ruin my sauce!_

Eventually, even at the lowest heat setting, the sauce may begin to boil. This is especially likely with gas burners. Find a way to raise the pot above the heating element. I just use metal tongs, but a wok ring or diffuser are also options. [Ask the Internet](https://www.chowhound.com/post/stove-burner-smaller-665499) for advice.

When the sauce is done, it will just look and smell done. It will have a delicious, oily sheen that says, "Feed me to a prospective mating partner." The sausages and whole onion will be especially popular among those who want to know your secrets. Tell them nothing.
