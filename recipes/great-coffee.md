# Great Coffee Wherever You Go

_By Steven Syrek_

I don't want to get into any arguments about how to make the best coffee. This method has served me well for years. Its advantages over other methods are low cost and portability. Can you get better results by tweaking the settings on an expensive espresso machine? Probably. But who cares? Also, try taking an espresso machine camping. One note: do not buy pre-ground coffee. Buy whole beans. Buy them regularly. Store them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place away from sunlight.

## Ingredients

- Your favorite coffee beans (I prefer espresso, but feel free to experiment)
- An [Aeropress](https://aerobie.com/product/aeropress/)

## Preparation

1. Grind two scoops of coffee beans, preferably using a [burr grinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_mill), but a spice mill will also suffice. A medium course grind is a good place to start if you don't otherwise know what you're doing. Dump the ground coffee into the assembled Aeropress.
2. Boil water using your preferred boiling method. I use an electric water boiler, myself. It just makes life easier.
3. Pour the boiled water into a Pyrex glass measuring cup or other not-too-deep vessel with a spout. Put a meat or candy thermometer into the water, and watch it carefully. When the temperature hits 180 degrees Fahrenheit, pour the water into the Aeropress. This is the critical step: do not just pour the boiling water directly into the Aeropress. You can try higher temperatures, if you want, but I wouldn't go lower than 175 degrees. This is a matter of taste, but I find most coffee to be far too hot (and consequently) far too bitter. You should at least make a deliberate choice, even if it isn't my choice.
4. Follow the usual Aeropress process, and enjoy your brew.
5. Once you've figured out your ideal blend of bean, grind coarseness, and water temperature, go argue about it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/).
