# Greek Salad for Winners

_By Steven Syrek_

I refused to eat tomatoes for the first 25 years of my life, because for my entire childhood I was only ever served watery, pink tomatoes from late 20th century supermarket chains. Then I went to Greece. I was a vegetarian at the time, and if you're a vegetarian in Greece there's nothing to eat except tomatoes. Lucky for me. This is one of those recipes that's really just a mixture of good ingredients. Use good ingredients and get good results. Use bad ingredients and you might as well consume Soylent. In other words, use good ingredients. And get the best Greek salad ever.

## Ingredients

- 2-3 small red tomatoes (tomatoes on the vine are perfect for this)
- 1 small or 1/2 large cucumber (or use however much you want)
- A handful of Kalamata or other Greek olives
- 1/4-1/3 a block of feta cheese or a handful of feta cheese crumbles
- Fresh oregano on the stalk, if you can find it
- The best extra virgin olive oil money can buy
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- A few sweet piquanté peppers (aka Peppadews), whole or sliced (optional)
- Fresh basil (optional)

## Preparation

Use a serrated blade to slice the tomatoes and a regular knife (or chef's knife) to slice the cucumber, both into cubes or any other pleasing but bite-sized shape. Dump into a large bowl. Also cube the feta if it's in block form, and sprinkle the cheese on top—as much as you like, but don't be ridiculous. Add a reasonable number of olives (you'll eventually figure out the balance of ingredients you prefer). Drizzle olive oil on top with an open heart. Crumble a mindful amount of fresh oregano on top of that, add a restrained dash of salt, and grind over the whole thing a free-spirited soupçon of pepper. You can experiment with other ingredients, if you like. I will sometimes add some basil, cut up with kitchen scissors, or a few peppadews if the mood strikes me. Basically, you can just grab anything that looks good from the olive bar. But start with the basic premise first before elaborating the plot. Don't forget to toss your salad. Serve with compassion.
