# Perfect Roasted Chicken

1. Procure any number of chicken parts. You can try larger or smaller pieces, or even a whole bird if you want. I prefer thighs, myself, and tend to cook 6-8 at a time. Breasts also work beautifully, but expect them to be a little bit drier. Do not use boneless cuts.
2. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Check the temperature using a standalone oven thermometer. I make no guarantees about the results of your cooking endeavors if you deign to trust your oven's built-in thermometer.
3. Place the chicken parts _skin side up_ in a large, rectangular baking pan (with steep sides). There should be some space between them.
4. Drizzle the chicken parts generously with extra virgin olive oil, and then sprinkle them judiciously with salt (preferably big, flaky kosher salt) and freshly ground black pepper (do not cheap out on your pepper, or just stop reading now and go do something else).
5. Sprinkle the pan with any other seasoning of your choosing (optional). Many markets sell seasoning blends for poultry, so you could experiment with those. I've used cumin, sumac, thyme, paprika, and Japanese shiso pepper (these either alone or in combination) to good effect. You can swish things around a bit at this point, so at least the underside of the chicken parts are coated with oil (to prevent them from sticking to the pan) but making sure to maintain some space between them.
6. Put the pan in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
7. Use metal tongs to flip the chicken parts over, taking care not to rend the skin.
8. Bake for another 15 minutes.
9. Flip the parts carefully again so they are once more skin side upâ€”this part is critical.
10. Bake for another 15 minutes.
11. Remove the pan from the oven, and let the chicken rest a few minutes, or until the pan juices calm down and stop burning you.
12. Serve with rice and/or your favorite sides, reserving the pan juices for gravy.
